# Project Overview
The code developed during a 4-week crash course on the basics of machine learning, courtesy of the Web and Coding Club, IIT Bombay. The course was a part of Learners' Space 2024 and several auxilliary resources
required to support the code were given. In many cases, the colab notebook loads the data from my Google Drive, in order for the code to run. The details of the weekly quoata of projects are explained below.
## Week 1: Basics
In week 1, much of what was covered was the basics of various useful python libraries. In particular, we were expected to know the ins and outs of **pandas, numPy and matplotlib** . SImple assignments going through
these were given.
